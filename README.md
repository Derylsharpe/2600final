# 2600final

Progress as of 4/29/2025:

The first version of blackjack was developed. However, the group would like to add some portions, such as splitting, a high score function, and achievements.
- Splitting would allow the player to play two hands after receiving a pair (two cards of the same value), and also bet on both hands, potentially increasing profits or heavy losses.
- The score function would relate to the actual betting portion of blackjack, where the player places a bet on their hand.
- Achievements would be based on certain actions that occur during the game. This is partly inspired by Balatro, the poker rogue-lite game, where the player plays for score and can receive achievements for action such as playing a number of rounds, playing a hand a certain number of times, etc. For blackjack, some achievements would be for example: beating the dealer for the first time, getting 21 as your hand total in two cards, winning streaks, etc. Potentially, these achievements and high scores can be stored in a file and accessed at a later time.
